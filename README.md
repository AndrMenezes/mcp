## Comparisons of ten corrections methods for t-test in multiple comparisons via Monte Carlo study
In this project we compared by extensively Monte Carlo simulations
the performance of the t-test and the ten corrections in the context of multiple comparisons of means.

## Monte Carlo simulation study for Post Hoc tests

In this project we evaluated the family-wise Type I error rate and the power of 10 tests used to
multiple comparison of means (post hoc).
